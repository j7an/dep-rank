# Release Guide

Quick reference for maintainers releasing a new version of `dep-rank`.

## Prerequisites

These are already configured. Verify once if something seems broken:

- [ ] CI is passing on `main`
- [ ] PyPI Trusted Publisher configured for the `pypi` environment
  (Settings → Environments → `pypi` → required reviewer set)
- [ ] TestPyPI Trusted Publisher configured for the `testpypi` environment
- [ ] Both environments use OIDC — no API tokens needed
- [ ] `Release Bot` GitHub App installed on this repo (needed to push signed
  tags; bypasses the recursion guard that blocks `GITHUB_TOKEN` tag pushes)
- [ ] `RELEASE_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY` secret stored at repo level
  (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Repository secrets)

## Releasing a New Version

### Stable release (UI-driven, recommended)

1. Go to **Actions → Tag Release → Run workflow**
2. Select the `main` branch and pick a `bump`:
   - `auto` — infer from Conventional Commits since the last tag
     (`feat:` → minor, `fix:` / `chore:` / `docs:` → patch,
     `<type>!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` → major)
   - `patch` / `minor` / `major` — override the auto analysis
3. Click **Run workflow**. The shared `tag-release.yml` reusable workflow
   computes the next version, creates and pushes a signed `vX.Y.Z` tag
   via the Release Bot App
4. The `v*` tag push triggers `publish.yml` (test → build → TestPyPI →
   PyPI → GitHub Release)

The "auto" bump analyzer reads commit subjects since the last tag, so
**Conventional Commits** matter: every commit in a PR should match the PR's
user-visible intent, not the per-commit diff shape. A stray `feat:` in an
otherwise-`fix:` PR will flip a patch release to minor.

### Pre-release (manual tag push)

The UI only offers `auto/patch/minor/major`, so pre-releases use a manual
tag push. The same `publish.yml` runs and the classifier flags the release
as prerelease automatically:

    git checkout main && git pull origin main
    git tag v0.2.0rc1       # or v0.2.0a1, v0.2.0b1, v0.2.0.dev1
    git push origin v0.2.0rc1

Use **PEP 440 canonical** forms (no hyphens): `a1` / `b1` / `rc1` / `.dev1`.

## What Happens Next (Automated)

The `publish.yml` workflow runs five jobs in sequence:

| Job | What it does |
|-----|--------------|
| `test` | Runs linting, type checking, and tests as a CI gate |
| `build` | Verifies the tag is on `main`, builds sdist + wheel via `uv build`, uploads artifacts |
| `publish-testpypi` | Publishes to TestPyPI, polls for availability, installs and smoke-tests the package |
| `publish-pypi` | **Waits for a required reviewer to approve** the `pypi` environment, then publishes |
| `github-release` | Creates a **draft** GitHub Release with auto-generated notes and attached artifacts |

Monitor progress at:
`https://github.com/j7an/dep-rank/actions`

---

## After the Workflow Completes

- [ ] Approve the `pypi` environment deployment when GitHub prompts you
- [ ] Verify the live package: `pip install "dep-rank==${VERSION}"`
- [ ] Smoke-test: `dep-rank --version`
- [ ] Open the draft GitHub Release, review auto-generated notes, and click **Publish release**

## Recovering from a Failed Release

### Build job failed (stable release)

The tag already exists. Fix the issue on `main`, then delete the tag and
re-run the Tag Release workflow:

    git tag -d "v${VERSION}"
    git push origin ":refs/tags/v${VERSION}"
    # merge the fix to main, then:
    # Actions → Tag Release → Run workflow → same bump as before

### Build job failed (pre-release)

Same delete-and-re-push, but the re-tag is manual:

    git tag -d "v${VERSION}"
    git push origin ":refs/tags/v${VERSION}"
    # merge the fix to main, then:
    git tag "v${VERSION}" && git push origin "v${VERSION}"

### Published to TestPyPI but PyPI failed

The wheel and sdist are already uploaded to TestPyPI (immutable). You can
publish to PyPI manually using the artifacts from the failed workflow run,
or bump to a patch version and re-release via the Tag Release workflow.

### GitHub Release not created

The `github-release` job only runs if `publish-pypi` succeeds. If it was
skipped, create the release manually:

    gh release create "v${VERSION}" dist/* \
      --title "v${VERSION}" \
      --generate-notes \
      --draft
